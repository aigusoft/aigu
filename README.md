# Web UI Framework for AI
- Hello humans, this framework is designed for AI!
# AIGU - Modern WEB UI Framework Designed for AI (AI Generator UI)
- Complete modern UI framework features, dependency management, etc.
- Full __WebComponents__ support 
- Ultra-clean and intuitive __ComponentJs__ syntax
- AI editing support
- No __"scaffolding"__ design, no __"VDOM"__, real-time rendering
- Other features inherited from the __"wcex"__ project
- ...

# Say No to TypeScript
Why say no to __TypeScript__ ? TypeScript is essentially a type system for JavaScript, designed for IDEs and humans. Since __AIGU__ is designed for __AI__, there's no need for TypeScript, as it would only introduce unnecessary complications.

# Enhanced WebComponent Specification
- Fully compliant with the enhanced WebComponent specification.
- Seamlessly integrates JavaScript with DOM, providing multi-level scoping and quick binding compared to traditional JavaScript inclusion, resulting in clearer DOM structure that's easier to edit and more suitable for AI processing.
